#Real-Time Chat Application

##A full-stack, real-time chat service built with Spring Boot, WebSockets, and Thymeleaf.

This application is a modern demonstration of bi-directional communication in web development. It leverages the power of Java and Spring Boot on the backend to manage user connections and message routing. The real-time functionality is achieved by establishing a WebSocket endpoint, enhanced by the STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol) for structured messaging. On the client side, SockJS ensures reliable connections across various browsers, providing necessary fallbacks. The user interface is dynamically rendered using Thymeleaf and styled with Bootstrap, resulting in a responsive, instant messaging experience.
